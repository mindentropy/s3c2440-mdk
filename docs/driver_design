Driver Design
=============

Bootloader:

For the bootloader all the definitions are present in include/common. This can be used
by C code as well as assembly code. The bootloader has to be as small as possible.

OS:
Initial design will have drivers without structures. We will have to pass the base address
of the instance. The reason of using helper macro's and small functions is because during
an ISR we do no want to call functions using callbacks.

The problem has arisen because of the target of the code for both small and large memories with
slow clock speeds.

The modelling of the driver will be similar to starterware architecture provided by TI and CMSIS
provided by ARM.


Architecture.
-------------

Have a register structure.

struct peripheral_regs {
	unsigned int REG1;
	unsigned int REG2;
	unsigned int REG3;
};

Have a control structure with the peripheral registers as an element in it.

What should be other parameters? Should it contain buffers? Should it contain
initialization of the controller and the devices attached to it?

1) Any hot path should be inlined or should be a macro.
2) Init should be modular and hence has to have good callbacks.

Hence the implementation should be a mixture of function callbacks and macros. For this
implementation how should the user prevented from being confused as to what to use?

struct peripheral_ctrl {
	/* 
	  State parameters
	 */

	
	structure peripheral_regs *regs;
};

We can create common functions which form the HAL. The layer underneath the HAL can
be changed for different architectures. This will not be callbacks.

All the above common functions will take an instance of the peripheral which is a pointer
to the structure. This will be also be modified based on the architecture.

All macro's has to be modified to take this instance. In this way we can achieve minimum
latency in interrupt servicing.

We will presently not use callbacks in a structure as we would like to reduce in function
calls in critical and hot code sections.
