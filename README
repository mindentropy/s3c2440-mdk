MDK OS and Microcontroller Development Kit
==========================================

This project has two goals:

1) To provide a microcontroller development kit which provides a framework for the
developer for creating different applications. All the internal details of initializing the system and handling
of peripheral controllers is handled by the system. 
2) To provide a working kernel to test the system which is extensible for further customizations.

Hardware
--------
Presently the OS runs on a FriendlyARM mini2440 board which has an ARM based Samsung S3C2440 CPU.

Building and Testing
--------------------

Environment:
The OS development is done on a Linux machine (Distro: Ubuntu).

Toolchain:
The tool chain is the cross compiler ARM tool chain provided by Linaro and which is present in the Ubuntu repository.
You can fetch the toolchain by doing a apt-get.

Building:
To build the OS and the loader run 'make' in the s3c2440-mdk folder. All binary files will be put in the 'bin' folder.
To build the uploader change the directory to test_uploader and run 'make' there.

Flashing:
A loader needs to flashed into the NAND memory which later loads the OS.

Flashing the loader:
1) Toggle the switch to NOR.
2) Boot the board to supervivi in NOR. In the menu select 'q' to go to 'vivi' shell.
3) In the command shell type in "load flash 0 <size_of_loader> u". This waits for a USB connection from the host.
   If a USB connection is established it loads the loader to the NAND at address 0. The size_of_loader will be the
   size of the mdk_os.bin file in the bin folder. You can check the size by doing a ls -al mdk_os.bin
4) To establish the connection from the host use the program 'dnw' or 'usbpush'.
   To upload the program using dnw
   a) unzip dnw. 
   b) Go to src/driver and compile the linux driver. After the driver is compiled
   	  do a sudo insmod ./secbulk.ko
   c) Now from the s3c2440-mdk folder you can do a ../dnw/dnw-linux/src/dnw/dnw bin/mdk_loader.bin. This will start uploading
      the loader on the the NAND flash.
5) To verify toggle the switch to NAND. A 'ldr' message should appear on your terminal program.
6) Now to upload the OS on to the RAM use the 'uploader' program in the 'test_uploader' folder.
7) To use the program type in ./test_uploader/uploader bin/mdk_os.bin. This will start uploading the OS on to the RAM.
8) After the OS upload is complete it runs the mdk_os automatically.
